# Perfect Episode Early Stopping

## Overview
The training script now implements intelligent early stopping based on **perfect episodes** - iterations where all agents successfully reach their waypoints without any conflicts.

## Implementation

### Key Changes

1. **Perfect Episode Detection**
   - Tracks if **all agents** reach their waypoints (`wp_hits == total_num_agents`)
   - Tracks if there are **zero conflicts** (`conflict_free_ep == True`)
   - A "perfect episode" requires both conditions to be met

2. **Consecutive Perfect Episode Tracking**
   - Maintains a `perfect_episode_streak` counter
   - Increments when an iteration has a perfect episode
   - Resets to 0 if any iteration fails the criteria

3. **Early Stopping Criteria**
   - Training terminates when `perfect_episode_streak >= 5`
   - This means 5 consecutive training iterations where:
     - All agents reached their waypoints
     - No conflicts occurred
   - Configurable via `PERFECT_STREAK_TARGET` variable (default: 5)

## Console Output

The training now displays enhanced progress information:

```
[0042] steps=84,000 eps_iter=3 episodes=126 reward_mean=15.432 throughput=125.3 steps/s 
       workers=4 zero_conf_streak=8 wp_hits=4/4 perfect=âœ“ 5/5

ðŸŽ‰ PERFECT TRAINING ACHIEVED!
   All 4 agents reached waypoints safely for 5 consecutive iterations.
   Training completed at iteration 42 with 84,000 steps.
```

### Output Fields
- `wp_hits=X/Y`: Number of agents that reached waypoints / Total agents in scenario
- `perfect=âœ“ N/5`: Current perfect episode streak (âœ“ for perfect, âœ— for not perfect)

## Training Progress CSV

The `training_progress.csv` now includes an additional column:

```csv
ts,iter,steps_sampled,episodes,reward_mean,zero_conflict_streak,perfect_streak
```

## Training Metadata

The final `training_metadata.json` includes:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "PPO",
  "scenario": "head_on",
  "total_num_agents": 4,
  "perfect_episode_streak": 5,
  "achieved_perfect_training": true,
  ...
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Training**: Stops as soon as the model is "good enough" (all agents succeed safely)
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents over-training once optimal behavior is achieved
3. **Clear Success Criteria**: Unambiguous metric for training completion
4. **Reproducibility**: Documented in metadata for analysis

## Environment Variables

You can customize the perfect streak target:

```bash
# Require 10 consecutive perfect iterations instead of 5
set PERFECT_STREAK_TARGET=10
python -m src.training.train_frozen_scenario
```

## Interaction with Other Early Stopping

The perfect episode early stopping works **in parallel** with the existing band-based early stopping:

- **Band-based**: Checks long-term stability over 8,200 step bands
- **Perfect episode**: Checks immediate success (5 consecutive iterations)

Whichever criterion is met first will terminate training, with preference to the perfect episode method as it's more stringent.

## Validation

To verify training quality after early stopping:

1. Check `training_metadata.json` for `"achieved_perfect_training": true`
2. Review `training_progress.csv` for the final `perfect_streak` value
3. Examine trajectory files to confirm all agents reached waypoints
4. Run evaluation episodes to validate the saved model

## Example Scenarios

### Head-On Scenario (2 agents)
- Perfect episode requires both agents to reach waypoints with no conflicts
- Typically achieves perfect training in 50-100k steps

### T-Formation Scenario (3 agents)
- Perfect episode requires all 3 agents to reach waypoints with no conflicts
- More challenging due to multi-agent coordination

### Canonical Crossing (4+ agents)
- Perfect episode requires all agents to reach waypoints with no conflicts
- Most challenging, may require 200k+ steps to achieve perfect training
