"""
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training Module.

This module provides comprehensive training capabilities for MARL collision avoidance
policies with support for multiple state-of-the-art algorithms and optimized
hyperparameter configurations.

Core Functionality:
- Multi-Algorithm Support: PPO, SAC, IMPALA, CQL, APPO with algorithm-specific tuning
- Parameter Sharing: Shared policy architecture across agents for efficient learning
- GPU Acceleration: Automatic CUDA detection and optimized configurations
- Early Stopping: Band-based performance evaluation prevents premature termination
- Progress Tracking: Detailed logging of training metrics and performance analysis
- Checkpoint Management: Automatic saving of best-performing models

Training Pipeline:
1. Scenario Loading: Loads conflict scenarios from src.scenarios
2. Environment Setup: Configures MARLCollisionEnv from src.environment  
3. Policy Training: Multi-agent learning with shared policy architecture
4. Performance Evaluation: Real-time conflict detection and efficiency metrics
5. Model Checkpointing: Saves best models for downstream evaluation

Training Philosophy:
Combines individual agent rewards (progress, safety, efficiency) with team-based
potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) to encourage coordination while maintaining
individual policy objectives. Training continues until stable conflict-free
performance is achieved.

Integration:
Trained models are evaluated using src.testing distribution shift frameworks
and analyzed using src.analysis hallucination detection and visualization tools.
